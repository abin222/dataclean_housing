# Melbourne Housing Data Cleaning

This repository contains resources for cleaning and analyzing housing data from Melbourne. The goal is to preprocess and clean the dataset to make it ready for further analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Files

1. **Melbourne+Housing+Data+Cleaning.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook that contains code and explanations for data cleaning and preprocessing. It walks through various steps such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.

2. **melbourne.csv**  
   The original dataset containing housing data from Melbourne. This CSV file includes various attributes related to properties such as price, location, type, and other features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see below)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/melbourne-housing-data-cleaning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd melbourne-housing-data-cleaning
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Required Libraries
